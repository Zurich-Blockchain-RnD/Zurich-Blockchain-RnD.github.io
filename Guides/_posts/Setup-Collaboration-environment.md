                <h6>Socials and other collaboration platforms:</h6>
                <p>The creation of innovation starts from a correct organization and planning. The collaborative space
                  must offer all the tools necessary to achieve the goal. For this reason, we have created a solid structure
                  that promotes advanced methodologies and techniques of project management, such as the AGILE and SCRUM methods.
                  Each project is independent and can decide which platforms to use to optimize the internal workflow.</p>
